# DukaFiti Deployment Fix Guide

## Migration Status: COMPLETED ✅

The application has been successfully migrated from Express server to a server-free, Supabase-only architecture suitable for Vercel deployment.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Build Configuration Issues
- ✅ Removed Express server and all backend dependencies
- ✅ Fixed CSS syntax errors preventing build
- ✅ Updated package.json scripts for frontend-only deployment
- ✅ Created proper Vite build configuration

### 2. Environment Setup
- ✅ Updated Supabase client to use VITE_ environment variables
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with required variables
- ✅ Configured Vercel deployment settings

### 3. Fixed Files
- `client/src/index.css` - Fixed CSS layer structure and removed duplicate declarations
- `package-build.json` - Clean frontend-only package.json
- `vercel.json` - Proper Vercel static deployment configuration
- `build.js` - Custom build script for production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Set environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key`
4. Deploy with build command: `vite build`
5. Output directory: `dist/public`

### For Manual Build:
```bash
# Clean build
node create-build-dir.js
npx vite build

# Output will be in dist/public/
```

## Current Project Structure

```
DukaFiti/
├── client/src/           # React frontend source
├── dist/public/          # Build output (created during build)
├── attached_assets/      # Assets accessible via @assets/
├── vercel.json          # Vercel deployment config
├── build.js             # Custom build script
└── package-build.json   # Clean frontend-only dependencies
```

## Environment Variables Required

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

## Import to New Replit Agent Instructions

When importing this project to a new Replit Agent, provide this prompt:

**"This is a React + Supabase frontend-only application called DukaFiti. It's been migrated from Express server to server-free deployment for Vercel. The app uses Vite for building, Supabase for backend services, and is ready for static deployment. Please maintain this architecture and don't add any Express server or backend code. All API calls go directly to Supabase."**

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Backend dependencies removed  
- ✅ Supabase client configured for environment variables
- ✅ CSS build errors fixed
- ✅ Vite build configuration working
- ✅ Vercel deployment configuration ready
