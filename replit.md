# DukaFiti Business Platform

## Overview

DukaFiti is a comprehensive business management platform built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application provides inventory management, sales tracking, customer management, and business analytics through an intuitive web interface. It's designed as a single-page application with a REST API backend.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for offline caching, Web App Manifest for installability

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with built-in authentication and real-time features
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- **API Design**: Direct Supabase client calls from frontend (serverless architecture)
- **Data Operations**: Supabase JavaScript SDK for all CRUD operations

### Data Storage Solutions

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational data model with the following core entities:
- **Products**: Inventory items with SKU, pricing, stock levels, and categories
- **Customers**: Customer information including contact details
- **Orders**: Sales transactions linked to customers with status tracking
- **Order Items**: Line items for each order with product references
- **Users**: System users with role-based access

### API Structure
RESTful endpoints organized by resource:
- `/api/products` - Product management (CRUD operations, search)
- `/api/customers` - Customer management
- `/api/orders` - Order processing and tracking
- `/api/dashboard/metrics` - Business analytics and KPIs

### UI Components
- **Layout System**: Responsive sidebar navigation with mobile support
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive set of reusable UI components
- **Forms**: Validated forms with real-time feedback
- **Data Tables**: Sortable and searchable data presentation
- **Charts**: Business metrics visualization (ready for chart integration)

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make direct Supabase API calls through TanStack Query
2. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth handles user sessions and security
3. **Database Operations**: Supabase JavaScript SDK executes queries with built-in security
4. **Real-time Updates**: Supabase real-time subscriptions provide live data updates
5. **UI Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and optimistic updates
