Assistant, I’ve uploaded two new Figma‑template designs to Replit—a Landing page template and a Sign‑In page template. Please implement them in code with **full functionality** and our existing brand:

---

## 1. Asset & Template Integration  
- Pull in the Figma‑provided HTML/CSS (or React JSX structure) for the Landing page and Sign‑In page templates.  
- Keep all template images and layouts (hero images, feature illustrations, background shapes).  
- Replace placeholder text/links/buttons with our real content and routes.

---

## 2. Landing Page  
- **Hero Section**  
  - Headline: “DukaSmart – Simplify Your Duka Operations”  
  - Subheadline: “Inventory, Sales, and Credit Management—all in one sleek POS.”  
  - CTA Buttons:  
    - “Get Started (Free 14‑day Trial)” → opens Sign‑Up modal  
    - “Learn More” → scrolls to Features section  
- **Features**  
  - Use our three core features:  
    1. “Easy Inventory” with real-time low‑stock alerts  
    2. “Instant Sales” supporting Cash, Credit & M‑Pesa  
    3. “Credit Management” with customer reminders  
  - For each feature card, hook icons/buttons to scroll or open detailed modals if clicked.
- **Testimonials**  
  - Replace example quotes with real text (e.g., “DukaSmart saved me hours every week!”).  
- **Footer**  
  - Include links to Dashboard (protected), Reports, Settings, and Contact Us (mailto).

## 3. Sign‑In Page  
- Use the template’s form layout but swap in our brand logo and slogan SVGs.  
- Fields:  
  - **Email** (with proper validation)  
  - **Password** (with show/hide toggle)  
  - **Remember Me** checkbox  
- Buttons & Links:  
  - “Sign In” triggers `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`  
  - “Forgot password?” opens Forgot‑Password flow  
  - “Don’t have an account? Sign Up” opens Registration flow
- Display success/error toasts upon submission.

---

## 4. Branding & Theming  
- Ensure all colors, fonts, and spacing match our established Tailwind theme (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `font-brand`).  
- Swap in the correct `logo-light`/`logo-dark` and `slogan-light`/`slogan-dark` assets based on theme.

---

## 5. Responsiveness & Accessibility  
- Verify the new pages look perfect on mobile, tablet, and desktop—use Tailwind responsive utilities.  
- Add ARIA labels, focus states, and keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.

### QA Checklist  
- [ ] Landing page matches Figma layout exactly, but with our real text and clickable CTAs.  
- [ ] All template images retained and correctly optimized.  
- [ ] Sign‑In page form validates and calls Supabase Auth, with proper feedback.  
- [ ] Branding (logos, colors, fonts) is consistent on both pages.  
- [ ] Pages are fully responsive and accessible.

Implement this end‑to‑end so our new designs are live, functional, and on‑brand.```
