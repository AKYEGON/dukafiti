Assistant, our Notifications panel is still too generic—we need each alert to reflect its real context (low stock, sale completed, payment received, sync error, etc.) and the Notifications **page** (the full view at `/notifications`) should show the same detailed items with clear icons, titles, and timestamps. Please update end‑to‑end so:

---

## 1. Notification Schema & Insertion

- **Table**: `notifications` already has `type`, `title`, `message`, `is_read`, `created_at`, `payload` (JSON).  
- **Populate** `payload` with context details when inserting:
  - **Low Stock**: `{ productId, productName, currentQty, threshold }`  
  - **Sale Completed**: `{ saleId, customerName, amount }`  
  - **Payment Received**: `{ saleId, method, amount }`  
  - **Sync Error**: `{ errorDetail }`  

Ensure all your server‑side or Edge Functions use this enriched payload.

---

## 2. TopBar Dropdown

- **Render** each notification with:
  - **Icon** based on `type` (⚠️ low‑stock, ✅ sale, 💰 payment, ⚙️ sync).  
  - **Title** = `title` field.  
  - **Message** = `message` or derived from `payload`.  
  - **Time** = relative (e.g. “5 min ago”).  

Drop the generic “Real‑time Test Notification” and instead show real data when you trigger through the tester or actual events.

---

## 3. Full Notifications Page at `/notifications`

- **List** all notifications in reverse chronological order, same styling as dropdown but full‑width.  
- **Columns** (desktop table) / **Cards** (mobile):
  - Icon  
  - Title  
  - Message / details  
  - Timestamp  
  - “View” link/button that navigates to the relevant page:
    - Low‑Stock → `/inventory?highlight=…`  
    - Sale → `/sales?invoice=…`  
    - Payment → `/sales?invoice=…#payments`  
    - Sync → `/settings#sync-errors`

## 4. Auto‑Mark Read Behavior

- When a user **expands** the dropdown or **visits** `/notifications`, mark all unread as read in Supabase and update the badge.

---

## 5. Files to Update

- **Server‑side/Edge Functions**: enrich payload on insert  
- **hooks/useNotifications.js**: ensure you read `payload` and pass it through to the UI  
- **components/NotificationsDropdown.jsx**  
- **pages/NotificationsPage.jsx**

### QA Checklist

- [ ] Trigger a low‑stock alert: see “Low Stock: Sukari (Qty 3 vs threshold 5)” in both dropdown and page.  
- [ ] Complete a sale: see “Sale Completed: KES 500 to John Doe” with a check‑icon.  
- [ ] Record a payment: see “Payment Received: KES 720 via M‑Pesa” with a money‑icon.  
- [ ] Force a sync error: see “Sync Error: Network timeout” with gear‑icon.  
- [ ] Opening dropdown or `/notifications` marks all as read.  
- [ ] “View” links navigate exactly to the related context page.

Implement these changes so notifications are specific, actionable, and truly reflective of real events.```
