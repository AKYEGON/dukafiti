Assistant, please overwrite our **Settings** page (`Settings.jsx` and related styles) with a polished, professional redesign—no new features, only refined UX/UI. Follow these specs:

1. **Layout & Structure**  
   - Wrap everything in a padded container (`p-6 lg:p-12`) with `space-y-8`.  
   - Use a two‑column grid on desktop (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6`), collapsing to one column on mobile.  
   - Section headers (“Store Profile,” “M‑Pesa Credentials,” “Manual Sync”) should be bold `text-xl` with a subtle underline colored `primaryPurple`.  

2. **Section Containers**  
   - Enclose each section in a tidy card:  
     - Light mode: `bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition`  
     - Dark mode: `dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] dark:border-gray-700 dark:shadow-[0_4px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.5)]`  
   - Add a right‑aligned “Edit” icon button in each header that toggles inline edit mode for that section.

3. **Form Styling & Interaction**  
   - Inputs: `w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primaryGreen`  
   - Buttons:  
     - **Save**: `bg-primaryGreen text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-primaryGreen-dark`  
     - **Cancel** (inline when editing): `bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 px-4 py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-300`  
   - Inline edit: clicking “Edit” turns static text into inputs; “Save” and “Cancel” appear in the section footer.

4. **Manual Sync**  
   - Render as its own card with a large centered **“Sync Now”** button (green, icon on left).  
   - On click: show a spinner in the button and disable it until complete, then change text to “Last synced just now.”

5. **Mobile‑First & Accessibility**  
   - Ensure all cards stack full‑width on screens `<640px` with `space-y-6`.  
   - Buttons and inputs have minimum touch target size (`h-12`).  
   - Include `aria-label` for icon buttons and proper focus styles (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primaryPurple`).

6. **Typography & Spacing**  
   - Use `text-base` for body text, `text-lg` for section headers.  
   - Maintain `leading-relaxed` and adequate line spacing (`space-y-4`) within each section.

7. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Desktop shows two columns of cards; mobile stacks them.  
   - [ ] Section headers display underline in purple.  
   - [ ] “Edit” toggles inline inputs; Save & Cancel buttons appear.  
   - [ ] Input fields and buttons use the correct Tailwind classes and theme colors.  
   - [ ] Manual Sync button shows spinner, disables during sync, and updates text.  
   - [ ] Dark mode styling matches light mode structure with inverted backgrounds.  
   - [ ] All interactive elements have focus rings and aria labels.

Generate the updated `Settings.jsx` (including JSX layout and Tailwind classes), any new shared components needed (e.g. editable section wrapper), and ensure the design is consistent with our primary green, black, and purple palette in both light and dark modes.```
