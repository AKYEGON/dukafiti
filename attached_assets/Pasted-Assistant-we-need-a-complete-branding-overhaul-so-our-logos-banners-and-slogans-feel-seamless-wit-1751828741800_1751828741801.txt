Assistant, we need a complete branding overhaul so our logos, banners, and slogans feel seamless with the UI—no more “patch” look. I’ll upload new asset images; once you have them, please:

---

## 1. Asset Integration  
- Copy the uploaded images (`banner-hero.png`, `logo-full.png`, `slogan-text.svg`) into `public/assets/`.  
- Ensure they’re optimized (correct dimensions, transparent backgrounds, compressed).

## 2. Hero & Landing Banner  
- In the Landing page, replace the existing hero banner with `banner-hero.png`.  
- Style it to **blend** under the header:  
  ```html
  <div class="relative overflow-hidden rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    <img src="/assets/banner-hero.png" alt="DukaSmart banner" class="w-full h-auto object-cover" />
    <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-black/50"></div>
    <div class="absolute bottom-8 left-8 text-white font-brand text-4xl">Your slogan here</div>
  </div>
3. Logo & Slogan Placement
Sidebar: replace with logo-full.png set as bg-transparent on a bg-neutral-100 container so it sits naturally.

TopBar (desktop): show slogan-text.svg as a subtle watermark behind the search input, 10% opacity.

TopBar (mobile): use only the icon portion of logo-full.png, sized to 32×32 px, centered in a transparent circle.

4. Component Backgrounds
Wrap any logo or banner in a matching background container (bg-neutral-100 or dark:bg-neutral-900) so there’s no rectangular “patch.”

Use Tailwind’s rounded-2xl and shadow-sm to give them gentle card‑like integration.

5. Global Theme Adjustments
In tailwind.config.js, update colors to match the new palette extracted from the uploaded banners/logos (use the eyedropper tool to get HEXs).

Apply the new font-brand to headers and slogans.

Consistently use bg-gradient-to-r from-primary to-secondary on section dividers to tie in the branding gradient.

QA Checklist
 New banner blends under header with gradient overlay and slogan text.

 Sidebar and TopBar logos display without visible rectangular patches.

 Slogan watermark in TopBar desktop is subtle and non‑intrusive.

 Color palette throughout matches the new assets exactly.

 All branding elements use rounded corners, shadows, and consistent fonts.

Once I upload the images, please apply these branding overhauls across all relevant pages to achieve a cohesive, professional look.``
