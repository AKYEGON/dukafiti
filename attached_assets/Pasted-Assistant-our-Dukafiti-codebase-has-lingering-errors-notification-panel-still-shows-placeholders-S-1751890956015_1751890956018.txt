Assistant, our Dukafiti codebase has lingering errors—notification panel still shows placeholders, Settings business info doesn’t persist, and offline sync is unstable. Please perform a **deep end‑to‑end audit and fix** so that:

---

## 1. Notifications Panel  
- **Remove all** hard‑coded/test data imports.  
- **Wire up** `useNotifications()` to:
  1. Fetch initial notifications from Supabase on mount.
  2. Subscribe to realtime INSERTs and prepend new items.
- **Compute** the unread badge from `is_read=false` in state.
- **Auto‑mark** all as read on panel open and clear the badge.
- **Render** each notification’s real `title`/`message`/`type` with correct icons and timestamps.

---

## 2. Settings → Business Info Persistence  
- On mount of the Business Info form, **re‑fetch** the record from Supabase and populate the form.  
- After save/upsert, **update local state** immediately and **don’t clear** the form.  
- Ensure if the user navigates away and back (or reloads), the saved values still appear.

---

## 3. Offline Queue & Sync  
- **Implement** a robust `offlineQueue` module (using IndexedDB/localForage) with `enqueue()`, `getQueue()`, `clearQueue()`.  
- **Wrap** all mutating Supabase calls—sales, restocks, credits—so if `!navigator.onLine`, they queue instead of firing.  
- **Auto‑sync** on `window.online` by replaying queued ops in order, handling errors, and clearing the queue.  
- **TopBar UI**: add an offline indicator and a sync button with pending‑ops badge, and toasts for queueing/sync results.

---

## 4. Real‑Time Inventory Updates  
- In `useInventory()`, fetch initial products, then subscribe to `products` updates (INSERT/UPDATE) to keep stock levels accurate across all pages without manual reload.

---

## 5. Deep Code Cleanup  
- Run ESLint/Prettier auto‑fixes, remove unused imports/files, and eliminate any leftover demo/test code.  
- Verify all React hooks (`useEffect`) have correct dependencies.  
- Ensure no console errors or warnings in devtools.

### QA Checklist  
- [ ] Notifications dropdown and page show only real Supabase notifications, badge clears on open.  
- [ ] Business Info stays saved across reloads and navigation.  
- [ ] Offline: actions queue; online: queue auto‑syncs and UI reflects changes.  
- [ ] Inventory reflects stock changes in realtime after sales.  
- [ ] No console errors; all linter issues auto‑fixed.  
- [ ] App passes manual tests for every flow (notifications, settings, offline, inventory, sales).

Please apply these comprehensive fixes so the Dukafiti MVP is stable, accurate, and production‑ready.```
