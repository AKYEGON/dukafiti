Assistant, the Notifications panel is still not reflecting real events correctly. Let’s fix this once and for all by ensuring we:

1. **Load Initial Notifications**  
   - On app start (or TopBar mount), fetch all notifications for `currentStoreId` from Supabase, ordered by `created_at DESC`, and store in state.

2. **Subscribe to Real‑Time Inserts**  
   - After fetching, open a Supabase real‑time channel on `notifications` for our store.  
   - On every `INSERT`, prepend the new notification to state immediately.

3. **Render Actual Payload Data**  
   - In the dropdown and the full Notifications page, display each notification’s actual `type`, `title`, and `message` fields (or derive human‑friendly text from the `payload` object) instead of generic placeholders.

4. **Badge & Read State**  
   - Compute the unread count from `is_read === false` in our state.  
   - On opening the panel, run a single `update({ is_read: true })` call filtering unread for this store, then update all local items to `is_read = true` so the badge clears.

### Files to Update

- **`hooks/useNotifications.js`** (or wherever you manage notification state):  
  - Add initial fetch, real‑time subscription, and cleanup on unmount.

- **`components/NotificationsDropdown.jsx`**:  
  - Use the state from `useNotifications` to map over real data, showing each `title`, `message`, timestamp, and an icon for its `type`.

- **`pages/NotificationsPage.jsx`**:  
  - Mirror the dropdown logic to render the full list, using the same state hook.

### QA Checklist

- [ ] Manually insert a “Low Stock” notification in Supabase → it appears instantly at top of dropdown with the correct product name and Qty.  
- [ ] Complete a sale → “Sale Completed” notification shows right away.  
- [ ] The red badge count matches new unread items and clears when I open the panel.  
- [ ] No generic “Test Notification” text remains—only real event data.  

Please implement these adjustments so the panel always shows **actual, up‑to‑date notifications** from Supabase.```
