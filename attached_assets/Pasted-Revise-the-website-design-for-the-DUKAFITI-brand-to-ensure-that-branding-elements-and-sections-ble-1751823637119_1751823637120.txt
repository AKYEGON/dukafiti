Revise the website design for the "DUKAFITI" brand to ensure that branding elements and sections blend seamlessly with their backgrounds while maintaining a professional and modern aesthetic. Use the provided branding images, which include various versions of the logo (cube), brand name ("DUKAFITI"), and slogan ("DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI") with different backgrounds (e.g., light gray, teal, dark teal, blue, transparent). Follow these specific requirements:





Landing Page:





Use the transparent versions of the logo (cube), brand name ("DUKAFITI"), and slogan ("DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI") in the top bar (header). Ensure these elements appear directly on the top bar’s background without their own distinct backgrounds, creating a seamless integration.



Select versions of the branding elements that provide sufficient contrast with the top bar’s background color (e.g., dark blue or teal) to ensure the text and logo are clearly visible and readable.



Sign-Up and Login Cards:





Set the backgrounds of the sign-up and login cards to be transparent or to match the main page’s background color, ensuring they blend seamlessly with the surrounding content.



Maintain readability of the text and form elements within the cards by ensuring sufficient contrast with the background.



Dashboard:





Configure the entire sidebar to have the same background color as the main dashboard area, creating a cohesive and unified look.



Ensure any text or elements within the sidebar are legible against this background, adjusting colors if necessary.



General Design:





Prioritize the use of provided branding images with transparent backgrounds (e.g., attachments labeled as transparent) to achieve the desired blending effect.



If necessary, adjust colors or select alternative versions of the branding images to maintain contrast and visibility against the chosen backgrounds.



Use a consistent color palette inspired by the branding images, such as dark blue (#1A3C6D) for backgrounds, light blue (#A3BFFA) or purple (#A7A4E0) for accents, and white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E5E7EB) for text.



Choose a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, or Roboto) for body text to complement the logo’s bold, hand-drawn, or rounded style while ensuring readability.



Include standard sections: Home, About, Services, and Contact, tailored to the "DUKAFITI" brand’s modern and approachable identity.



Ensure the website is fully responsive, functioning well across all devices and screen sizes, with optimized performance for fast loading.

The final website should reflect the "DUKAFITI" brand’s modern and approachable identity, with all elements visually cohesive, professional, and seamlessly integrated with their backgrounds.
