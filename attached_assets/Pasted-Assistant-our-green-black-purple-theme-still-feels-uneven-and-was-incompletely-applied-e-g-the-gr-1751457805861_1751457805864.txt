Assistant, our green/black/purple theme still feels uneven and was incompletely applied (e.g. the graph card on Reports didn’t update). I’d like you to perform a **thorough, research‑backed color redesign** and then implement it **across every component** with attention to aesthetics, consistency, and accessibility. Please overwrite existing styles and configuration. Your response should:

## 1. Research & Color Theory Rationale  
1. **Color Harmony**  
   - Use a **triadic palette** built around our base green (`#00AA00`), purple (`#6B46C1`), and a neutral black/gray.  
   - Select complementary accent shades (e.g. a softer mint green for highlights, a lavender for secondary elements) using a color‑tool‑backed approach (e.g. Adobe Color CC, Coolors).  
2. **Accessibility & Contrast**  
   - Verify all text and UI elements meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** for contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI).  
   - Define these ratios in a small accessibility table referencing exact hex pairs.  
3. **Emotional Tone & Branding**  
   - Explain how the updated greens convey growth/trust, purples convey creativity/professionalism, and blacks provide grounding.  
   - Show sample mockups or HEX swatches in the documentation.

## 2. Tailwind Configuration & Palette Update  
- In `tailwind.config.js`, define named color tokens with light, DEFAULT, and dark variants for:  
  ```js
  emerald: { light: '#50C878', DEFAULT: '#00AA00', dark: '#007F3D' },
  lavender: { light: '#B497BD', DEFAULT: '#6B46C1', dark: '#54308A' },
  neutral:  { 50: '#F7F7F7', 100: '#E1E1E1', DEFAULT: '#1F1F1F', 900: '#000000' }
Enable darkMode: 'class'.

3. Component‑Level Styling Overhaul
Graph Cards (Reports Page)

Card background: bg-neutral-100 (light) / dark:bg-neutral-900.

Border: border-emerald (light) / dark:border-lavender.

Chart lines/bars: use emerald for primary series, lavender for secondary, and a neutral gray for gridlines.

Axis labels: text-neutral-900 / dark:text-neutral-100.

Summary Cards (Dashboard)

Background: bg-white / dark:bg-neutral-900.

Accent bar or icon: bg-emerald.

Title text: text-neutral-800 / dark:text-neutral-200.

Buttons & Interactive Elements

Primary: bg-emerald hover:bg-emerald-dark text-white.

Secondary: bg-lavender hover:bg-lavender-dark text-white.

Disabled: bg-neutral-300 text-neutral-600.

Forms & Inputs

Borders: border-lavender, focus ring ring-emerald-light.

Placeholder text text-neutral-500 / dark:text-neutral-400.

4. Dark‑Mode Variants
Use dark: variants to invert backgrounds and switch accent borders appropriately.

Update global CSS to ensure any hard‑coded colors (e.g. graph card) are replaced.

5. Implementation Steps & QA
Automate Color Tokens: Update Tailwind and refactor any bg-... or text-... usages to use the new tokens.

Graph Library Theming: For charts (Recharts/Chart.js), inject the new palette into the chart’s colors array and configure tooltips/axes.

Global Component Refresh: Overwrite a shared Card component to enforce the new aesthetics.

QA Checklist:

All pages show updated backgrounds, borders, and accents with the refreshed palette.

Graph cards and charts use the new triadic colors correctly.

Text and UI elements meet contrast ratios.

Dark mode flips correctly and remains accessible.

Conduct a brief visual audit listing pages with before/after screenshots.

Please produce:

A short research summary (color tool references, contrast table, emotional rationale).

The full updated tailwind.config.js.

Overwrite code for Card.jsx, chart config for Reports, and a sample of 2–3 core pages (Dashboard, Sales, Reports) to illustrate the new palette applied end‑to‑end.
