Create a professionally branded website for the "DUKAFITI" brand using the provided branding images and design specifications. The website should have a modern, responsive design with the following key features:





Landing Page:





Use the transparent versions of the logo (cube), brand name ("DUKAFITI"), and slogan ("DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI") in the top bar (header). Ensure these elements blend seamlessly with the top bar’s background, which should be a color consistent with the branding, such as dark blue (#1A3C6D) or teal (#008080), as seen in the provided images.



Select versions of the branding elements that provide sufficient contrast with the top bar’s background to ensure the text and logo are clearly visible and readable.



Sign-Up and Login Cards:





Set the backgrounds of the sign-up and login cards to a solid purple color, matching the deep purple shade used in the sidebar header of the provided design (attachment 37, approximate hex code: #4B0082). This ensures the cards blend with the brand’s aesthetic.



Ensure text and form elements within the cards are legible against the purple background, using white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E5E7EB) for contrast.



Dashboard:





Configure the entire sidebar to have a solid purple background, matching the deep purple color used in the sidebar header of the provided design (attachment 37, approximate hex code: #4B0082). This creates a cohesive look, avoiding multiple colors in the sidebar.



Ensure all text and icons within the sidebar are clearly visible against the purple background, using white (#FFFFFF) or light-colored text and icons.



General Design:





Prioritize the use of provided branding images with transparent backgrounds (e.g., attachments labeled as transparent) to achieve the desired blending effect in the top bar and other sections.



For any cards or panels throughout the website (e.g., feature cards, pricing panels), set their background color to the same purple as the sign-up/login cards and sidebar (approximate hex code: #4B0082) to maintain consistency.



Maintain a consistent color palette inspired by the branding images, including dark blue (#1A3C6D) for backgrounds, light blue (#A3BFFA) or purple (#A7A4E0) for accents, and white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E5E7EB) for text.



Choose a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, or Roboto) for body text to complement the logo’s bold, hand-drawn, or rounded style while ensuring readability.



Include standard sections: Home, About, Services, and Contact, tailored to the "DUKAFITI" brand’s modern and approachable identity.



Ensure the website is fully responsive, functioning well across all devices and screen sizes, with optimized performance for fast loading.

The final website should reflect the "DUKAFITI" brand’s modern and approachable identity, with all elements visually cohesive, professional, and seamlessly integrated with their purple and dark-colored backgrounds.
