Prompt #1: Add Vercel Configuration
markdown

Assistant, please add a `vercel.json` at the project root to tell Vercel how to build and serve our React PWA:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build", "config": { "distDir": "build" } }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
– This ensures Vercel runs npm run build, then serves the contents of build/ as a single‐page app.

Generate that vercel.json file for me.

### Prompt #2: Update `package.json` Scripts for Vercel  
```markdown
Assistant, overwrite our `package.json` scripts so Vercel can build and start our React app:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "vercel-build": "npm run build"
}
– Add "vercel-build": "npm run build" as Vercel’s default build command.
Generate the updated package.json with only those changes in the scripts section.

### Prompt #3: Document Vercel Environment Variables & Setup  
```markdown
Assistant, create a step‑by‑step guide (for README or a dev doc) on how to add our env vars in the Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to Vercel → Projects → *Your Project* → Settings → Environment Variables.  
2. Click “Add” and enter:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://<your‑supabase>.supabase.co`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `<your‑anon‑key>`
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://dukasmart‑api.onrender.app`
3. Set each to “Production” (and “Preview” if desired), then Save.  
4. Trigger a new deployment by pushing any commit or clicking “Redeploy.”

Output this as Markdown for inclusion in our README.
Prompt #4: Outline Publishing & Distribution Steps

Edit
Assistant, write a simple “Deploy & Distribute” section for our README that covers:

- **Deploy to Vercel**:  
  1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel.  
  2. Add env vars as above.  
  3. Vercel auto‑deploys on push to `main`.  
- **PWA Install**:  
  - Users can “Add to Home Screen” on mobile browsers.  
- **Mobile App Packaging (Optional)**:  
  - Use Capacitor to wrap in Android/iOS as covered earlier.  
- **Custom Domain**:  
  - How to add `app.dukasmart.co.ke` in Vercel Domains and update DNS.

Generate that as a concise markdown section.
