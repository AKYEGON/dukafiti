Assistant, please apply the following updates across the Dashboard, Quick Actions, and Customer pages—overwrite existing code as needed:

---

## 1. Dashboard: Remove Percentage Displays  
1. In `Dashboard.jsx`, locate the summary cards for Total Revenue, Orders Today, Inventory Items, and Active Customers.  
2. Remove any `<span>` or `<div>` that renders the percentage change under each value.  
3. Adjust the card layouts so the numeric value (e.g. “KES 12,345”) is centered vertically, with no empty gap below.  
4. Ensure the cards still fetch and display their main values correctly from `/api/metrics/dashboard`.

---

## 2. Quick Actions: Remove Keyboard Shortcut Labels  
1. In your `QuickActions.jsx` (or wherever the buttons are defined), find the labels like “Ctrl+P”, “Ctrl+O”, etc.  
2. Delete those labels so each button simply shows its icon and text (e.g. “Add New Product”, “Create Order”).  
3. Ensure no leftover `<kbd>` or `<small>` elements remain.  
4. Confirm the click handlers and routing still work exactly as before.

## 3. Customer Page: “Edit” & “Record Repayment” Fixes  
1. **Edit Button & Autofill**  
   - Replace the “View Customer” button on each customer card with an **“Edit”** button styled the same.  
   - Clicking “Edit” opens the existing Add/Edit Customer modal pre‑filled with that customer’s name and phone.  
   - On submit, PUT to `/api/customers/:id` to save updates, then refresh the Customer list.

2. **Record Repayment Bug**  
   - In the `RecordRepaymentModal.jsx` handler, ensure the POST to `/api/customers/:id/payments` includes the correct remaining balance calculation:
     ```js
     newBalance = currentBalance - repaymentAmount;
     ```
   - After saving, update the stored `customer.balance` in the database and in local state.  
   - Refresh the customer card so it shows the new reduced balance immediately.

3. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Dashboard cards no longer show percentages, values aligned correctly.  
   - [ ] Quick Actions buttons display only icon and text, no shortcut hints.  
   - [ ] Clicking “Edit” on a customer card opens the modal with correct pre‑filled data.  
   - [ ] Saving edits updates customer info in the list.  
   - [ ] Recording a repayment deducts the amount from balance, both backend and UI reflect the change.  
   - [ ] No console errors or broken UI flows after changes.

Generate all updated React components (`Dashboard.jsx`, `QuickActions.jsx`, `Customers.jsx`, modals), the Express PUT `/api/customers/:id` handler if needed, and the fixed repayment POST logic in the modal component.```
