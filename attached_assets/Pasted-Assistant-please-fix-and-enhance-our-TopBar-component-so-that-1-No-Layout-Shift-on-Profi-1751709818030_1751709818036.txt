Assistant, please fix and enhance our **TopBar** component so that:

1. **No Layout Shift on Profile Click**  
   - Remove any CSS rules (e.g. `overflow-hidden`, width transitions) that cause the page content or sidebar to resize when the profile dropdown toggles.  
   - Ensure the dropdown is positioned absolutely over the content without affecting layout.

2. **Search Panel Functionality**  
   - Convert the current static input into a **smart search** that queries Supabase in real‑time:
     - Debounce input by 300 ms.  
     - Search across products and customers:  
       ```js
       const { data: products } = await supabase
         .from('products')
         .select('id,name')
         .ilike('name', `%${query}%`);
       const { data: customers } = await supabase
         .from('customers')
         .select('id,name')
         .ilike('name', `%${query}%`);
       ```
     - Merge results into a single dropdown list, grouping by type with a header (“Products”, “Customers”).

3. **Clickable Dropdown Items**  
   - Render each result as a button:
     - **Product** rows link to `/inventory` and scroll/highlight that product’s card.  
     - **Customer** rows link to `/customers/:id` to open that customer’s detail page.  
   - Use `react-router`’s `<Link>` or `navigate()` so clicking immediately pushes the correct route and closes the dropdown.

4. **Dropdown UI/UX Polish**  
   - Style the dropdown as a card under the search input:  
     - Light mode: white background, gray border, slight shadow.  
     - Dark mode: dark background, subtle border, glow on hover.  
   - Up/down arrow navigation through items, Enter to select.  
   - “No results” message when empty.

5. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Clicking the profile icon no longer shifts or resizes the sidebar or page content.  
   - [ ] Typing in search triggers real‑time queries and populates dropdown.  
   - [ ] Arrow keys move focus; Enter selects.  
   - [ ] Clicking a product result navigates to Inventory and highlights that item.  
   - [ ] Clicking a customer result navigates to the correct customer detail page.  
   - [ ] Dropdown closes on selection or outside click, with no layout disruption.

Generate the updated `TopBar.jsx` (or equivalent), the search hook logic, Tailwind classes for the dropdown, and any router/navigation code required to implement these fixes.```
