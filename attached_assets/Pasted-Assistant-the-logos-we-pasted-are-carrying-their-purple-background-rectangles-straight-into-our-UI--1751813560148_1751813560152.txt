Assistant, the logos we pasted are carrying their purple‐background rectangles straight into our UI—let’s fix that so the **icon**, **wordmark**, and **slogan** float cleanly over our brand background:

---

## 1. Replace Logo Assets with Transparent Versions  
- Swap out `logo-full.svg` and `logo-slogan.svg` in `src/assets/` (or `public/assets/`) with **transparent‐background** exports (PNG or SVG). Make sure their artboards are tight to the artwork—no extra purple fills.

## 2. Component Backgrounds & Containers  
- Everywhere we show a logo (Sidebar, TopBar, Landing, Auth pages, Footer), wrap the `<img>` in a container with our brand purple as its background. For example, in Sidebar:
  ```jsx
  <div className="p-4 bg-primaryPurple flex items-center justify-center">
    <img src="/assets/logo-full.svg" alt="DukaSmart" className="h-10" />
  </div>
Use the same purple (bg-primaryPurple) in Tailwind across all logo wrappers.

3. Adjust Tailwind Theme
In tailwind.config.js, confirm:

js
Copy
Edit
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primaryPurple: '#6B46C1', // your brand purple
    }
  }
}
Remove any direct color fills in the logo <img> tags—logos should rely on their own shapes.

4. Text & Contrast
On purple backgrounds, ensure any overlaid text (e.g. the slogan on the landing page) is text-white or text-neutral-100 for contrast.

Use drop-shadow on the logo if needed to help it pop:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="/assets/logo-full.svg" className="h-10 drop-shadow-md" alt="DukaSmart" />
5. QA Checklist
 All logos now float on a solid purple block, not their own purple fill.

 No “purple box” remains around any logo—only the container shows purple.

 Contrast & sizing consistent across Sidebar, TopBar, Landing, Auth, and Footer.

 Light/dark modes still work: in dark mode, containers switch to a slightly darker purple (dark:bg-primaryPurple-dark).

Apply these changes so our logos blend seamlessly into the purple brand background without carrying their own unwanted fill.```
