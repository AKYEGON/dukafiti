Assistant, please refine our existing **Confirm Sale** modal for credit payments—polishing the UX/UI without altering its core fields or flow. Overwrite only the modal’s presentation and interactions to make selection and addition of customers smoother and more intuitive:

1. **Modal Layout & Styling**  
   - Keep header “Confirm Sale” and the list of line items unchanged.  
   - Wrap content in a rounded, drop‑shadow card (`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6`) that adapts to dark mode (`dark:bg-[#1F1F1F]`).

2. **Customer Input Section**  
   - Replace plain text inputs with a combined **Customer** autocomplete field:
     - A single input labeled “Customer (search or add new)” with placeholder text.  
     - When typing, show a dropdown of matching existing customers (name and phone) under the input.  
     - Selecting one auto‑fills both name and phone internally.  
   - Below the dropdown, if no match is chosen, show two inline fields in the same card area:  
     - Name (required)  
     - Phone (optional)  
     - These inputs should appear only when the user clicks an “+ Add new customer” button inside the dropdown.

3. **Interactions & Feedback**  
   - Autocomplete dropdown:  
     - Styled as a bordered list with `bg-white dark:bg-[#2A2A2A] border rounded-md shadow-sm mt-1`.  
     - Each item `px-4 py-2 hover:bg-primaryGreen-light dark:hover:bg-primaryGreen-dark cursor-pointer`.  
   - “+ Add new customer” appears as the last dropdown item, bold and green.  
   - When “+ Add new customer” is clicked, collapse the dropdown and reveal the inline name/phone fields with a smooth height transition.

4. **Confirm Button Enablement**  
   - Keep the “Confirm Sale” button disabled until either an existing customer is selected or the new customer name field is non‑empty.  
   - Once valid, button becomes full‑opacity green (`bg-primaryGreen`) and clickable.

5. **Accessibility & Keyboard**  
   - Ensure the autocomplete and inline fields are all keyboard‑navigable (arrow keys for dropdown, Tab to fields).  
   - Inputs have `aria-label` and clear focus rings (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primaryGreen`).

6. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Typing in the customer input shows existing matches.  
   - [ ] Selecting a match fills name/phone automatically.  
   - [ ] “+ Add new customer” reveals inline fields without disrupting layout.  
   - [ ] Confirm Sale button only enables when customer info is valid.  
   - [ ] No change to other modal fields or overall sales flow.  

Generate the updated JSX/Tailwind code for this existing modal—preserving all other fields and logic—so the customer selection/addition experience is seamless and professional.```
