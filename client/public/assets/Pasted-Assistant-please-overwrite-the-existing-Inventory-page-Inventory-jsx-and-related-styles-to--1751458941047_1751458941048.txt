Assistant, please overwrite the existing **Inventory** page (`Inventory.jsx` and related styles) to deliver a clean, professional UX/UI—no new features, only a polished redesign. Follow these specs:

1. **Layout & Responsiveness**  
   - Desktop: show a two‑column grid of product cards.  
   - Mobile: switch to a single‑column list with full‑width cards.  
   - Add a sticky top toolbar with a left‑aligned “Inventory” title (text‑xl, font‑semibold) and a right‑aligned search input (“Search products…”, with a search icon inside).

2. **Product Card Design**  
   - Each card should include:
     - Product Name (text-lg, font-bold)  
     - Unit Price (`KES X,XXX`, text‑base)  
     - Stock Quantity and Threshold (`Qty: X`, `Low Stock: Y`)  
     - Two buttons at the bottom: **Edit** and **Delete** (green and red respectively, px-4 py-1, rounded-md, full‑width on mobile).  
   - Card styling (Light mode): `bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition`  
   - Dark mode: `dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] dark:border-gray-700 dark:shadow-[0_4px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.5)]`

3. **Search & Sort**  
   - The search input filters the visible cards in real time (no new API).  
   - Above the grid, add a sort dropdown (“Sort by: Name ▲/▼, Price ▲/▼”) that reorders the in‑memory list.

4. **Loading & Empty States**  
   - While fetching data, show skeleton placeholders (gray animated blocks) matching card dimensions.  
   - If no products exist, center a friendly message “No products found” with a lighter icon.

5. **Consistent Theming**  
   - Use the established palette:  
     - Primary buttons: `bg-primaryGreen text-white`  
     - Secondary / Delete: `bg-red-600 text-white`  
     - Borders and shadows use subtle gray/black as per light/dark mode.  
   - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast.

6. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Desktop: two‑column grid; Mobile: single‑column.  
   - [ ] Sticky toolbar with title, search, and sort.  
   - [ ] Cards show all product info; buttons labeled “Edit” & “Delete.”  
   - [ ] Cards animate on hover with shadow.  
   - [ ] Search and sort work instantly client‑side.  
   - [ ] Skeletons appear during load; empty state displays correctly.  
   - [ ] Dark mode styling applies properly.  

Generate the fully updated React component(s), Tailwind config adjustments, and any utility hooks (e.g. for search/sort) necessary to implement this redesign.```
