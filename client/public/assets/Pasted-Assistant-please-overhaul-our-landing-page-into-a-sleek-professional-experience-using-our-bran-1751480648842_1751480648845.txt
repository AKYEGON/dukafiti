Assistant, please overhaul our **landing page** into a sleek, professional experience using our brand colors (green, black, purple). No extra features—just polish. Overwrite existing `Landing.jsx`, CSS, and layout:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Full-width hero with heading: “DukaSmart – Smart POS for Kenyan Dukawalas”
   - Subheading: benefit-oriented sentence.
   - Primary CTA button (“Get Started – It’s Free” in bright green) prominently above fold.
   - Subtle hero graphic/video (optimized) on the right of the hero.

2. **Content Flow**
   - Arrange sections vertically: Hero → Features → Testimonials → Footer.
   - Features: three-highlight columns with icons, headings, and short descriptions, using alternating green/purple accent borders.
   - Testimonials: two client quotes with border-left accent in purple.

3. **Visual Design & Spacing**
   - Use lots of white (or black in dark mode) space: `p-12 lg:px-24 xl:px-32`.
   - Typography: Headings bold and large (`text-4xl` hero, `text-2xl` section titles); body `text-base leading-relaxed`.
   - Use green (#00AA00) for buttons and accent borders; purple (#6B46C1) for highlights and borders.

4. **Navigation & CTA**
   - Use minimal nav: Logo on left, single “Login” button on right.
   - CTA button repeated in footer: “Get Started Now”.

5. **Responsive & Mobile**
   - Mobile viewport stacks hero vertically, CTA full-width with `py-4` touch size.
   - All images/video optimized and lazy-loaded.

6. **Trust Elements**
   - Add a testimonials section with neutral cards (`bg-white dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] border-purple rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm`).

7. **Accessibility & Performance**
   - Ensure all text meets WCAG contrast.
   - Lazy-load visuals and optimize assets.

8. **QA Checklist**
   - [ ] Hero headline, subheadline, and CTA appear above fold.
   - [ ] CTA button visible in both hero and footer.
   - [ ] Feature icons/sections align and use our brand color styling.
   - [ ] Testimonials render properly.
   - [ ] Mobile screen looks polished with large tap targets.
   - [ ] Designed for both light/dark mode.
   - [ ] No console errors; non-blocking lazy loading of resources.

Please generate the updated `Landing.jsx`, including JSX structure, responsive Tailwind CSS classes, hero media inclusion, testimonial cards, and footer CTA.
