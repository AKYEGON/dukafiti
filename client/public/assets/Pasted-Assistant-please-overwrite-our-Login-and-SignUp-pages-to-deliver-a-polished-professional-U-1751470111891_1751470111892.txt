Assistant, please overwrite our **Login** and **SignUp** pages to deliver a polished, professional UX/UI suitable for a POS app—without adding unnecessary features. Use research-backed best practices and ensure both light and dark mode aesthetics:

---

### A. Layout & Visual Hierarchy

- Center both forms vertically and horizontally on the screen.  
- Enclose form inside a card:
  - Light: `bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 w-full max-w-sm`
  - Dark: `dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] dark:border-gray-700 dark:shadow-lg`
- Logo or app name at top (centered): `text-2xl font-bold text-primaryPurple`

---

### B. Form Fields & Labels

- Include only essential inputs:
  - **Login**: Email, Password
  - **Sign Up**: Name, Email, Password, optional "Show password" toggle
- Place labels **above** inputs, not placeholders
- Inputs styled:  
  `w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primaryGreen`
- Use real-time validation:
  - Show inline errors below fields with red text (`text-red-500 text-sm`)
  - Clear error when field is corrected

---

### C. Buttons & Call-to-Action

- Use distinct primary buttons:
  - Login button (`bg-primaryGreen hover:bg-primaryGreen-dark text-white`) labeled “Log In”
  - Sign up button (`bg-primaryPurple hover:bg-primaryPurple-dark text-white`) labeled “Register”
- Buttons are full-width and touch-friendly: `py-3 font-semibold rounded-md`
- Place a small “Forgot password?” link under the password field: `text-xs text-primaryPurple hover:underline`, aligned left

---

### D. Switch Between Login & Sign Up

- Include clear toggler at bottom:
  - On login: “Don’t have an account? Register”
  - On signup: “Already have an account? Log in”
- Link styled as `text-primaryGreen hover:underline`, easy to spot

---

### E. Accessibility & Mobile Considerations

- Ensure inputs and buttons are sized for thumbs (`min-h-[44px]`), with sufficient spacing
- Inputs retain value on validation errors
- All interactive elements: keyboard-focusable, accessible labels, `role="button"` where needed
- Ensure input fields stay visible when on-screen keyboard opens

---

### F. Dark Mode Readiness

- Use `dark:` variants consistently:
  - `text-white` for labels and placeholder text
  - `bg-[#1F1F1F]` for backgrounds
  - Input borders swap to `dark:border-gray-600`
