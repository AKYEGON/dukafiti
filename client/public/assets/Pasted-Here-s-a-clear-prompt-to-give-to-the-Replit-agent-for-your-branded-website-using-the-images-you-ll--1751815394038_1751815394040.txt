Here’s a clear prompt to give to the Replit agent for your branded website, using the images you’ll upload:

"Create a professionally branded website for my brand 'DUKAFITI' using the provided branding images. The brand's logo features a minimalist isometric cube and the text 'DUKAFITI,' with the tagline 'DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI.' I have uploaded multiple versions of the logo, including ones with different backgrounds (gray, blue, teal, black), as well as standalone images of the cube, the text 'DUKAFITI,' and the tagline.

Please design a modern, responsive website with the following specifications:

Header: Use the logo that includes both the cube and 'DUKAFITI' text. Select a version that best matches the website's color scheme.
Color Palette: Derive the website's colors from the provided images, using dark blue for backgrounds, light blue or purple for accents, and white or light gray for text.
Tagline Placement: Integrate the tagline 'DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI' prominently, perhaps in the hero section or footer.
Logo Usage:
Use the cube-only logo as the favicon.
Consider using the text-only 'DUKAFITI' for headings or buttons if it fits the design.
Use the tagline image for a banner or promotional area.
Responsiveness: Ensure the website is optimized for all screen sizes.
Standard Sections: Include Home, About, Services, and Contact pages, tailored to the brand's identity.
Typography: Choose a sans-serif font like Montserrat or Roboto for body text to complement the logo's style.
Additional Images: If there are any other images provided, incorporate them appropriately, such as for backgrounds or illustrations.
The final website should be visually consistent, professional, and reflective of the 'DUKAFITI' brand's modern and approachable nature."

Design Considerations for the Website
To create a professionally branded website, the following aspects were considered:

Logo Placement: The logo with both cube and "DUKAFITI" should be in the header for brand recognition. Versions with transparent backgrounds can be used for flexibility, while those with solid backgrounds (e.g., dark blue) can be used for banners.
Color Palette: The website should use the colors from the images, such as dark blue for backgrounds, light blue or purple for accents, and white or light gray for text, ensuring consistency.
Tagline Integration: The tagline "DUKA BORA NI DUKA FITI" should be prominent, possibly in the hero section or footer, using the provided tagline images for consistency.
Logo Variations: Different versions (cube-only for favicon, text-only for headings) ensure versatility across the site.
Responsiveness: The website must be optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring the logo and tagline are visible on mobile devices.
Typography: Given the hand-drawn, bold style of the logo, a sans-serif font like Montserrat or Roboto is recommended for body text to complement the design, maintaining readability.
Sections: Standard sections (Home, About, Services, Contact) should be included, tailored to the brand’s identity, possibly using additional images for backgrounds or illustrations if provided.
