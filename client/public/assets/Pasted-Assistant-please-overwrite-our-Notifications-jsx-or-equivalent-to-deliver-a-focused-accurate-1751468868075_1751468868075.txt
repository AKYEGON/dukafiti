Assistant, please overwrite our **Notifications.jsx** (or equivalent) to deliver a focused, accurate notifications experience:

1. **Single Consistent Page Title**  
   - Remove all duplicate headings.  
   - Add a single `<h1>Notifications</h1>` at the top, styled `text-2xl font-semibold px-6 py-4`.

2. **Fetch & Display Relevant Notifications**  
   - On mount, call GET `/api/notifications?dukaId={currentStoreId}` which returns notifications tied to this duka (e.g. low-stock alerts, new M-Pesa payments, sync errors).  
   - Display them in a list sorted by newest first. Each item shows:
     - Icon (e.g. bell or alert)  
     - Title (e.g. “Low stock: Sukari”)  
     - Timestamp (formatted `HH:mm, MMM D`)  
     - Optional link or “View” button to jump to that context
   - Style each notification card:  
     - `bg-white dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-4 mb-3 shadow-sm`  
     - On hover: `hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-[#2A2A2A]`.

3. **Mark As Read & Badge Count**  
   - Add a “Mark all as read” button at the top right of the list.  
   - When individual notifications or “read all” are clicked, call POST `/api/notifications/mark-read` (with IDs) and update the badge count in the TopBar.  
   - Unread items have a colored left border (`border-l-4 border-primaryGreen`), read items use `border-l-4 border-transparent`.

4. **Empty State & Loading**  
   - While fetching, show skeleton rows (`animate-pulse bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 h-16 mb-3 rounded`).  
   - If no notifications, center “You have no notifications” with a neutral icon.

5. **Accessibility**  
   - Ensure list items are focusable, have `role="button"`, and `aria-label` including the title and timestamp.

6. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] Only one page title “Notifications” appears.  
   - [ ] Notifications fetched are relevant to the current store.  
   - [ ] Unread/read states toggle correctly and badge count updates.  
   - [ ] “Mark all as read” functions and updates UI.  
   - [ ] Empty and loading states display properly.  
   - [ ] Dark mode styling consistent with other pages.

Generate the updated **Notifications.jsx**, the API route stubs if needed, and any styling updates to implement these changes.```
