Assistant, update the **Reports → Orders Record** section so each order row/card shows the **total money spent** and a **brief list of products & quantities**. Please overhaul both backend and frontend:

1. **Backend – Enhance Orders Endpoint**  
   - Modify the existing GET `/api/reports/orders` to include for each order:
     ```js
     {
       orderId,
       date,
       customerName,
       totalAmount,            // total money spent on this order
       status,
       items: [                // brief list
         { productName, qty },
         …
       ]
     }
     ```
   - In your database query, join order headers with their line items, summing prices for `totalAmount`, and map item names and quantities into `items[]`.

2. **Frontend – Orders Table/List UI**  
   - **Desktop Table**:  
     - Add two new columns:
       - **Amount (KES)**: right‑aligned cell showing `totalAmount` with comma separators.  
       - **Products**: cell showing up to 3 items formatted as `"Name xQty"`, separated by commas (e.g. “Sukari x2, Maize x1…”), and “+N more” if over 3.  
   - **Mobile Cards**:  
     - Under the header row, display:
       - **Amount:** bold “KES X,XXX”  
       - **Items:** a line “Items: Sukari x2, Maize x1, …” truncated after 50 characters with ellipsis.  
   - Use Tailwind for styling:  
     - Table cells `px-2 py-1`, mobile cards `p-4 mb-2 bg-gray-800 rounded border`.  
     - Amount in green text (`text-green-400`) for paid orders, yellow for pending.

3. **State & Data Handling**  
   - Ensure the React fetch for `/api/reports/orders?period=…&q=…` now reads the new `items` and `totalAmount` fields.  
   - Update your table render and mobile card render logic to loop over `items` and display name & qty.

4. **QA Checklist**  
   - [ ] API response includes `totalAmount` and `items[]` for each order.  
   - [ ] Desktop table shows correct amount and a comma‑separated item list with “+N more” when needed.  
   - [ ] Mobile cards display amount and truncated item list.  
   - [ ] Styling matches green/yellow conventions for status.  
   - [ ] No layout breaks when orders have many items.

Please generate the updated Express route code, the React table component changes, mobile card JSX, and the QA checklist.```
