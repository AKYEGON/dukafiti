Assistant, I realized I uploaded two assets—a **full‑logo** (with wordmark + icon) and a **slogan‑only** graphic—and we need to use them correctly across the app. Please update every page to use them professionally and consistently:

---

## 1. Assets Placement  
- Ensure the two files are in `public/assets/` (or `src/assets/`):
  - `logo-full.svg` (icon + wordmark)
  - `logo-slogan.svg` (wordmark + slogan)

## 2. Sidebar & TopBar  
- **Sidebar**: display `logo-full.svg` at the top, linking to `/dashboard`.  
- **TopBar (mobile view)**: show only the icon portion (you can extract it from `logo-full.svg` or use a separate `logo-icon.svg` if available) at 24×24 px; clicking still expands profile/search.  
- **TopBar (desktop view)**: show `logo-slogan.svg` (wordmark + slogan) centered or on the left before the search input.

## 3. Auth & Landing Pages  
- **Login/SignUp** and the **Landing** page hero: use `logo-full.svg` above the forms or hero headline.  
- Below the logo on these screens, add the slogan as text (from `logo-slogan.svg`) or inline SVG—ensure proper alt text for accessibility.

## 4. Favicon & Tab Title  
- Generate favicons from the **icon portion** of the logo (16×16, 32×32) and place in `public/`.  
- In `public/index.html`, set `<title>YourAppName – Your Slogan</title>`.

## 5. Footer & Email Templates  
- In the app footer, slim down to the slogan only (`logo-slogan.svg`) at 150 px width, followed by copyright.  
- If you have email notification templates, embed `logo-full.svg` in the header and `logo-slogan.svg` in the email signature area.

### QA Checklist  
- [ ] Sidebar shows full logo; TopBar desktop shows slogan version; TopBar mobile shows icon only.  
- [ ] Auth and landing pages display the full logo above the main content and the slogan beneath.  
- [ ] Favicons and tab titles reflect the icon and branding text.  
- [ ] Footer and email templates use the slogan asset appropriately.  
- [ ] No missing or broken image errors.

Apply these changes across all relevant components so our branding is clear, consistent, and professional.```
