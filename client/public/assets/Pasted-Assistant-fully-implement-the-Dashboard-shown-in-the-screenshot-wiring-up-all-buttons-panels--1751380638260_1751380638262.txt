Assistant, fully implement the **Dashboard** shown in the screenshot, wiring up all buttons, panels, and metrics—and remove the Alerts panel completely. Here’s exactly what I need:

1. **Recent Orders Table**  
   - Fetch the latest 10 orders from `/api/orders/recent`, each with `{ id, customerName, totalAmount, status }`.  
   - Display them in the table under “Recent Orders” with columns: Order ID, Customer, Amount (formatted KES with comma separators), and Status.  
   - Add a “View All” link in the upper‑right that navigates to `/orders` (the full orders list page).  

2. **Quick Actions Panel**  
   - Replace the static buttons with real navigation and shortcuts:  
     • **Add New Product** button: styled green, icon “+”, clicking opens the Add‑Product modal or navigates to `/inventory/new`. Assign shortcut `Ctrl+P`.  
     • **Create Order** button: icon of a cart, clicking navigates to `/sales`. Assign shortcut `Ctrl+O`.  
     • **Add Customer** button: icon of a user “+”, clicking opens the Add‑Customer modal or `/customers/new`. Assign shortcut `Ctrl+U`.  
     • **Generate Report** button: icon of a chart, clicking navigates to `/reports`. Assign shortcut `Ctrl+R`.  
   - Implement all four click‑handlers and keyboard shortcuts in React (use a hotkey library or `window.addEventListener`).

3. **Remove Alerts Panel**  
   - Delete the entire Alerts card from the dashboard.  
   - Expand the Quick Actions and Recent Orders cards to fill the space responsively.

4. **Percentage Metrics**  
   - If you show any percentage metrics (e.g. “% growth” or “% of target”) in summary tiles or cards, calculate them dynamically:  
     • Fetch baseline values and current values from `/api/metrics` (e.g. `{ todaySales, yesterdaySales }`).  
     • Compute percentage change as `((today - yesterday) / yesterday) * 100`, round to one decimal place, and display with a “+” or “–” sign.  
   - Ensure these percentage values match the live data and update when the dashboard loads or on manual sync.

5. **Styling & Layout**  
   - Maintain the green (#00AA00)/black theme and Tailwind classes across all new buttons and table rows.  
   - Ensure the layout is mobile‑friendly: on narrow screens, Quick Actions stack below Recent Orders.

Please generate all necessary React components, API fetch logic, routing or modal invocations, keyboard‑shortcut code, styling updates, and removal of the Alerts panel.```
