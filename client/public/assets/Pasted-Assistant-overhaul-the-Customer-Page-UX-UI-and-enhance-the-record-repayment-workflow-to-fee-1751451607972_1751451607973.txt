Assistant, overhaul the **Customer Page UX/UI** and enhance the **record repayment** workflow to feel more professional, intuitive, and mobile-friendly. Please overwrite existing components and styling. Here’s the full plan:

---

### 1. **Customer Page Layout & Styling Overhaul**

- **Top Section:**
  - Add a clean header: **“Customers”** with a green accent underline and a large “+ Add Customer” button on the right (purple button with icon).
  - Below the header, add a horizontal search + filter bar:
    - A search input: “Search by name or phone…”
    - Dropdown filter for: “All | With Debt | No Debt”

- **Customer List Display:**
  - Replace any plain tables with a responsive **grid of cards**, each styled with:
    - White or black background (based on dark mode)
    - Green border if they have outstanding debt, gray otherwise
    - Customer name (bold), phone number, total debt (`KES X,XXX`)
    - “View” and “Record Repayment” buttons inside the card footer
    - On hover: purple glow, cursor pointer, slight lift (`shadow-xl` and `hover:-translate-y-1`)
  - On mobile: cards stack vertically with full width.

### 2. **Enhanced “Record Repayment” Flow**

- When **“Record Repayment”** is clicked:
  - Open a modal or side panel with this layout:
    - Title: “Record Repayment for [Customer Name]”
    - Display:
      - Total owed: `KES X,XXX`
      - Previous payments (short list: Date, Amount)
    - Input field: **Repayment Amount**
    - Select method: `Cash | Mobile Money` (styled as toggle buttons)
    - Optional notes field: “Note or reference (optional)”
    - “Save” button (green, full width), and “Cancel” button

- On Save:
  - POST to `/api/customers/:id/payments` with `{ amount, method, note }`
  - Update customer balance, save transaction, and show a toast “Repayment recorded”
  - Close modal and update customer card immediately

### 3. **UX & UI Enhancements**

- **Interactivity & Feedback:**
  - Use toast notifications for actions like “Customer added”, “Payment recorded”
  - Add loading spinner on buttons while saving
  - Animate card appearance with `framer-motion` (fade+slide)
  - Add subtle animations for modal open/close

- **Accessibility:**
  - All buttons and inputs have `aria-label`
  - Keyboard-accessible navigation in modals
  - Color contrasts meet WCAG 2.1 AA
