Assistant, please overwrite our **Home (Dashboard)** page to deliver a sleek, professional user experience informed by best practices in dashboard design. No new features‚Äîjust refined layout, visuals, accessibility, and performance. Follow this structured plan:

---

## üéØ 1. Audience, Hierarchy & Layout  
- **Five‚Äësecond rule**: ensure users grasp key metrics within 5 seconds :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **F/Z reading pattern**: position the most critical metric at top-left, followed by supporting info :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **Single-column on mobile**, multi-region on desktop:  
  - **Mobile (`sm:`)**: stack vertically with padding `px-4 py-4`, tight `space-y-6`.  
  - **Desktop**: use `container mx-auto p-6` and a grid:  
    ```
    grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-1 gap-8
      ‚îú‚îÄ Summary Cards
      ‚îú‚îÄ Quick Actions
      ‚îî‚îÄ Recent Orders
    ```
  - Maintain consistency between devices :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

---

## 2. Summary Cards (Top KPIs)  
- **Layout**: Four cards in a responsive grid (`grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4`, gap `4`)  
- **Design**:  
  - Light: `bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition`  
  - Dark: `dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] dark:border-gray-700`  
- **Content**:  
  - Icon in a colored circle (consistent with green/purple theme)  
  - Metric label (`text-sm uppercase text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`)  
  - Large value (`text-2xl font-bold`)  
- **Best practices**: big bold numbers, clear grouping, minimal clutter :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## 3. Quick Actions  
- Render buttons as **actionable cards**:  
  - `flex items-center justify-center bg-primaryPurple text-white rounded-lg px-6 py-4 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition transform hover:-translate-y-1`  
  - Uniform size (`min-w-[180px]`)  
- Maintain consistent spacing and visual hierarchy :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## 4. Recent Orders  
- Title row with ‚ÄúRecent Orders‚Äù (`text-xl font-semibold`) and optionally ‚ÄúView All‚Äù link to a full list.  
- **Desktop table**:  
  - `table-auto w-full text-sm bg-white dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] rounded-lg`  
  - Header: `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200`  
  - Rows: zebra shading, amount right-aligned, status badges (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)  
- **Mobile cards**: stacked cards with clear spacing (`bg-white dark:bg-[#1F1F1F] p-4 rounded-lg mb-4`)  
- Include tooltips or hover highlights for clarity :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## 5. Performance & Feedback  
- Use **skeleton loaders** while data is fetching: `animate-pulse bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded`  
- Keep the UI responsive and efficient‚Äîlazy-load lists when many items exist :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## 6. Color & Accessibility  
- Stick to your palette of green, purple, and black with WCAG AA contrast (min 4.5:1) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Backgrounds: `bg-white` ‚Üî `dark:bg-[#1F1F1F]`  
- Text: `text-neutral-900` ‚Üî `dark:text-neutral-100`, secondary in gray tones  
- Buttons/icons colored with primary green/purple  
- Interactive components must have clear hover/focus states (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primaryGreen`)
