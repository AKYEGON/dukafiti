Assistant, please upgrade our **TopBar search panel** into a full “smart search” feature that is both powerful and user‑friendly. Overwrite or update the TopBar and any helper files so that:

---

## 1. Live “Smart” Search Behavior

- **Debounce** user input by 300 ms before firing queries.
- **Simultaneously** search across:
  - **Products** (`name`, `sku`)
  - **Customers** (`name`, `phone`)
  - **Sales** (`invoiceNumber`, `customerName`)
- Use Supabase client calls:
  ```js
  const { data: products } = await supabase
    .from('products')
    .select('id,name,sku')
    .ilike('name', `%${query}%`);
  // similar for customers and sales
2. Grouped, Keyboard‑Navigable Dropdown
Render results in a single dropdown under the search input, grouped under headers:

“Products”

“Customers”

“Sales”

Each item shows:

Icon (product/customer/sale)

Primary text (e.g. product name)

Secondary text (e.g. SKU or phone)

Keyboard support:

↑/↓ to move selection

Enter to pick

Esc to close

3. Intelligent Navigation on Selection
When a user clicks or presses Enter on an item:

Product → navigate to /inventory?highlight=<product.id>

Customer → navigate to /customers/<customer.id>

Sale → navigate to /sales?invoice=<invoiceNumber>

Use React Router’s useNavigate() so the page switches instantly and the relevant record is auto‑scrolled/highlighted.

4. Polished UI/UX
Dropdown styling:

Light mode: white background, gray border, subtle shadow

Dark mode: #1F1F1F background, gray‐700 border, soft glow on hover

Animations:

Fade+slide‐down on open

Hover highlight on each row

Responsive:

Full‑width panel on mobile

Touch‑friendly sizing (min height 44 px per item)

5. Files to Update
components/TopBar.jsx (search input, dropdown logic)

hooks/useSmartSearch.js (debounce & query logic — create if missing)

styles/TopBar.module.css or Tailwind classes for dropdown styling

✅ QA Checklist
Typing “sugar” shows matching products/customers/sales.

Arrow keys move through items; Enter navigates correctly.

Clicking outside or pressing Esc closes the dropdown.

No layout shift or overflow when dropdown is visible.

Works seamlessly in both light and dark themes.

Implement this with React + Supabase + Tailwind to deliver a truly useful smart search in the TopBar.```
